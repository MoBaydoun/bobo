### Congratulations! You can now start working on the engine ðŸŽ‰
If you run into any issues regarding spdlog, you might need to run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Coding Conventions

- Brackets are always new-line.
- Locally scoped variables are camelCased.
- Function names are PascalCased.
- Static variables must be prefixed with "s_" and the remaining in PascalCase.
- Pointer variables must be prefixed with "p_" and the remaining in PascalCase.
- Member variables must be prefixed with "m_" and the remaining in PascalCase.

```c++
// Brackets:
if (true)
{

}

// Variables:

int main()
{
    int camelCase = 5; //local
}

class Example
{
public:
    void Foo();
    void Bar()
    {
        bool localVariable = true;
    }
private:
    static int s_StaticVariable;
    int* p_PointerVariable;
    int m_MemberVariable;

    static int* s_StaticPointerVariable; // static supersedes pointer. s -> p -> m
}
```

## Branching
Now that you've made it this far and are ready to make some changes, start by creating your own branch.
(P.S: when I use brackets, it is to show where to insert text, there should be no actual brackets)
#### First, you want to make sure that you are on the right branch:
```bash
git branch
```
If you are on the **main** branch, then you are on the right track!
Then, we will create our own branch with the following command:
```bash
git checkout -b [name of branch]
```
#### Branch Naming Conventions
Just to keep our GitHub tidy and our commit history clean, the following naming conventions will be enforced:
```bash
feature/[feature-title-separated-by-hyphens]
bugfix/[brief-bug-description-separated-by-hyphens]
misc/[janitorial-changes-separated-by-hyphens]
```
The changes will be enforced by a git hook, so that should help you to avoid making any mistakes.
Also, keep your name out of the branch name.

#### Once you're done with your work, you can start a pull request:
First, you need to add, commit, and push your changes.
```bash
git add *
git commit -m "A descriptive message, providing an overview of the changes you are committing."
git push origin [name of branch]
```
Then you can head over to our GitHub page and start click the green merge request button that appears at the top of the page.
